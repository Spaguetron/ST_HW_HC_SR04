  The HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor works by sending 8 40kHz pulses when triggered
and measuring the time those pulses took to go and return. If it ever receives
back the packets, then it sets the ECHO pin to HIGH for the same duration it
waited for the packets to go and return.

  For this reason, setting an timeout is very important. Otherwise, the default
timeout for the Aruino pulseIn function may leave all code blocked for up to
one second. The default timeout for the ST_HW_HC_SR04 library is 5000
microseconds, which should be enough for approximately 86 cm (33.85 in).

  To make the sensor send the pulses, the TRIG pin needs to be set to
HIGH for at least 10 microseconds and then be immediately deactivated.

Approximate distance formulas:
 * hitTime / 29 = distance [centimeters]
 * hitTime / 74 = distance [inches]

A bit more accurate distance formulas:
 * hitTime / 29.10 = distance [centimeters]
 * hitTime / 74.75 = distance [inches]

Approximate maximum timeout based on desired maximum distance formulas:
 * maxTimeout = (desiredDistance[cm] * 58)  [microseconds]
 * maxTimeout = (desiredDistance[in] * 148) [microseconds]
